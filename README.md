# E-Commerce Database Management Project
Database Management University Course


Together with my teammates, we analyzed the data requirements of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Hepsiburada, and Trendyol, and developed a scalable and optimized database management system. Within the scope of the project, conceptual (EER), logical, and physical modeling stages were completed, and a database was created using SQL DDL commands.

My Contributions:

Analyzed and designed EER diagram the e-commerce database of Amazon
Created and optimized the database using SQL DDL commands.
Ensured data integrity with Trigger, Check Constraints, and SELECT queries.
Performed test operations with sample datasets.
